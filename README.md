Github for my Website for my minecraft server I host with friends
Sorry for the horrible github page, will probably update in the future.

## stuff that needs to be done
* Fix typos, I'm sure I made a lot, mainly in `guide/index.html`
* Finish the other wiki pages
* Make more wiki pages.
* fix the weird spacing on the nav bar (play has more space between it and the left thing compared to the right thing)

## some things to know about this when you're reading the code
The eagler ip, java ip, map link, and form link are all in a data.json file in the scripts folder which gets read and replaces the empty spots. That json file isn't in the repository to somewhat hide the original website for this. please don't add that stuff back.
If you want to reference those stuff, create a <a> tag with one of the ids in `scripts/main.js`

Please don't break the barely mobile support this has, and the light/dark mode support that this has.
