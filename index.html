    <h1>hi there welcome to the homepage for my silly minecraft server!</h1>
    <p>Hi, I host a minecraft server intended for everyone in my school district to enjoy minecraft while we're finished with our school work, or just whenever we have the free time to enjoy.
        <br>It is joinable using EaglercraftX and I provide a client to do so. IP: <span id="eaglerIP"></span>
        <br>It is also joinable through Minecraft Java 1.8.8 using the IP: <span id="javaIP"></span></p>
    <p>Interested in joining? If you're in the same district as me then fill this form <a class="external" id="formInner" href="#"></a> &lpar;<strong>You need to be signed into your school email</strong>, if you are and it lets you into the form you are in the same district as me&rpar;</p>
    <p>We have a discord for the members in the server! If you are a player on the minecraft server you can join here <a class="external" id="discordInner" href="#"></a></p>
    <p>I made a guide on how to host a eaglercraftX server the same way I host this one, if that interests you go ahead and <a href="guide/index.html">take a look</a></p>
    <p>Want to contribute to the site? <a class="external" href="https://github.com/Millymilo000/milssillyserver-website">We have a github of the site now!</a></p>

            <h2>12/3/2024 - New Rule, and Eaglercraft 1.12 news!!</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! recently I found that a lot of 1 person nations have formed. Now, I'm not super mad, but the whole point of the Nation server type is for people to work together to make a wonderful nation, with incredible builds, and to conquer other nations, but you can't really do that in a 1 person nation.
                <br>That is why I made <a href="rules.html#r20">a new rule</a>, it states that
                &quot;1 Person nations are not allowed&quot;, &quot;If a nation is found to only have 1 member after 4 days of the nation being created, it will be disbanded.&quot;, and &quot;If you break this rule 2 times, you will be banned from creating new factions for 60 days.&quot;
                <br style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
                Boring rule stuff aside, Eaglercraft 1.12 news time.
                <br>Recently the developers of Eaglercraft 1.12 have announced that they will be making it public later this week, they also mentioned that it's likely there will be quite a bit of bugs at first. So to make us of help, and to test how buggy Eaglercraft 1.12 is, I will be making Eaglercraft 1.12 the default client on this website. Please if you run into any bugs let me know so I can let the developers know about it, so they know what to fix. If the bugs do cause too much of an issue though, don't worry, the server will still be 1.8, and I will still leave the 1.8 Eaglecraft client on the website, accessible by holding the &quot;O&quot; key while clicking the &quot;Play!&quot; button, or you can click the arrow by the play button, and select &quot;EaglercraftX <em>&lpar;1.8&rpar;</em>&quot;
                <br>Once we find that Eaglercraft 1.12 is stable enough I will change the server to a 1.12 server. Currently how I'm thinking I'll do that, is I will just keep the same world we have, and I'll extend it to introduce the new 1.12 world generation.
                <br style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
                Well that was a lot of stuff, probably the biggest blog post, not sure how to end a blog post, I guess just, hope you're enjoying the server so far!
